### Nginx Interview Question

#### Q1: What is Nginx?

**A1:** Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server that is also used as an HTTP cache and load balancer. It is known for its stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

#### Q2: Can you explain the main difference between Nginx and Apache?

**A2:** Nginx and Apache, both being popular web servers, have distinct differences. Nginx is event-based, handling multiple requests within one thread, making it highly efficient for high traffic websites. It excels in serving static content quickly and uses less memory when dealing with concurrent connections. On the other hand, Apache operates on a process-driven model, creating new threads for each request, which can consume more resources under heavy load. However, Apache’s .htaccess feature allows directory-level configuration, providing flexibility that Nginx lacks.

#### Q3: How would you compile Nginx from source, and why might you need to do this?

**A3:** To compile Nginx from source, first ensure that the prerequisite software (PCRE library, zlib library, and OpenSSL library) is installed. Then download the Nginx source code tarball from the official website. Extract it using ‘tar -zxvf’ command. Navigate to the directory containing the extracted files and run ‘./configure’, specifying any modules you want to include or exclude with ‘–with’ or ‘–without’. After configuration, use ‘make’ to compile and ‘make install’ to install.

Compiling from source might be necessary if pre-built packages do not meet specific needs. It allows customization of modules, enabling or disabling as per requirements. Additionally, it ensures having the latest version, which may not be available in package repositories.

#### Q4: Can you describe a scenario where you would use Nginx as a reverse proxy?

Nginx can be used as a reverse proxy in a scenario where load balancing is required. Suppose we have an application that has grown significantly and one server isn’t enough to handle all the incoming traffic. We could use Nginx as a reverse proxy to distribute client requests across multiple servers, ensuring no single server becomes overwhelmed. This would improve performance and reliability of our application.
